# ThreeJS Mini Test Project

This project is a very basic example of Three.js, a JavaScript library used for creating 3D graphics in the browser. The app showcases how to set up a simple 3D scene with a rotating pyramid object and a background image, using basic materials and geometry. Additionally, the app includes interactivity for the pyramid object, allowing users to change its color by clicking on it. This project serves as a demonstration of the basic concepts and usage of Three.js.
